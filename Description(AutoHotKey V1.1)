# GradualThrottle-AHK

A lightweight AutoHotkey v1.1 script that simulates **analog throttle** for keyboard controls in racing and simulation games.  
Instead of sending a constant input when holding a key, it gradually increases the keypress rate to mimic smooth acceleration.  

## Features
- Gradual acceleration for `W/A/S/D` keys
- Adjustable start delay, acceleration rate, and minimum delay
- Toggle on/off with **F9**
- Auto-disables gradual mode after a set hold time (returns to normal key behavior)
- Small on-screen indicator (disappears after 2s) when toggled

## Usage
1. Install [AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Run the script
3. Press **F9** to arm gradual throttle mode  
4. Hold `W` (or other movement keys) to start smooth acceleration

## Applications
- Racing games without native analog input
- Flight sims or driving sims using only a keyboard
- Accessibility use for smoother control curves
